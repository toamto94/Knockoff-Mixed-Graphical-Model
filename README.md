# Knockoff-Mixed-Graphical-Model
This is an algorithm for training a graphical model for associations between variables, some of which are qualitative and some quantitative.
The algorithm uses the model-X framework promoted by Cand√®s et al. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02351] which controls the proportion of falsely discovered edges,
$\sum_1$
